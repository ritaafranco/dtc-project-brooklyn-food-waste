# DTC Project: brooklyn food waste
This repo contains my code for DataTalkClub's DE Zoomcamp Project. 

A huge thanks to DataTalks Club Team for creating this great [DE Zoompcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)!!

# Goal
This project aims to create a data pipeline that processes data that will help answer the following questions:
* Which food products are most wasted in Brooklyn?
* Which kind of food is wasted the most? (ready-to-eat, perishable, packaged or shelf stable)

# Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ursulakaczmarek/brooklyn-food-waste), it contains data used to research the relationship between food waste and the date labels found on those wasted food items. The data was collected by picking up items directly from retailer trash piles at random in the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhood in New York City.


# Dashboard
The dashboard can be found [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/c01d8ee8-3423-465d-b8dc-c3ed280cb9d2). In case the data is not showing it means the free credits in my Google Cloud account are over, then please consult image bellow.
This dashboard allows some conclusions on the data such as:
* The most wasted food product are yogurts.
* The average price of wasted products is approximatly $5.57.
* The majority of produtcs is collected on expiration date day, however some are wasted before that date.
* Around 60% of wasted food products are perishable.
